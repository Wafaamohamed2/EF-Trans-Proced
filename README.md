## EF Transactions and Stored Procedures Project : 
   This project demonstrates the use of Entity Framework (EF) Core for managing database transactions and stored procedures.
   It includes examples of how to configure the DbContext, execute transactions,
   and call stored procedures in a .NET Core project.

## Project Overview :
   The project is designed for learning purposes .. that require database interaction with transactions and stored procedures.

## Using Transactions and Stored Procedures :
   1- Transactions: You can use EF Core to manage database transactions, 
   ensuring that multiple related operations are committed or rolled back as a single unit.  

   2- Stored Procedures: EF Core allows you to call stored procedures using raw SQL queries.
   This is useful when you have complex logic in the database that you donâ€™t want to replicate in the application code.
